<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Mediha LetiÄ‡. I am 24 years old. I come from a small country called Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>I have a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. I am currently in my last year of my master's degree.</p>

<p>Although I am an electrical engineer, Web Development has always been attractive to me, and this summer I decided to improve my programming skills.</p>

<p>I enjoy doing sport in my free time. I go to the gym 4 to 5 times a week. Cooking is another great love of mine. I like to try new recipes and improve old ones that have proven to be good.</p>
